    "Hi all! Welcome to the 2nd assignment of this course! Here, you will learn how to build a singing voice transcription system (SVT) for songs, a system that help you convert singing voice in audio into note-level notations. This assignment contains 3 sections:\n",

    "2. The entire transcription workflow,\n",
    "3. Some extension questions.\n",

    "You are required to:\n",
    "- Finish this notebook. Successfully run all the code cells and answer all the questions.\n",
    "- When you need to embed screenshot in the notebook, put the picture in './resources'.\n",
    "- After finishing, **zip the whole directory (please exclude data_mini directory)**, then submit to Canvas. **Naming: \"eXXXXXXX_Name_Assignment2.zip\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment constitutes 15% of your final grade, but **the full marks of this notebook are 48**. We will normalize your score when computing final grade, i.e., Your assignment 2 score = [Your Score] / 48 * 15.\n",

    "**Honor Code**\n",
    "Note that plagiarism will not be condoned. You may discuss the questions with your classmates or search on the internet for references, but you MUST NOT submit your code/answers that is copied directly from other sources.
