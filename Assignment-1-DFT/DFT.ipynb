    "This assignment presents an introduction of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), a straightforward case study of its application, and a simple implementation of DFT. It aims to offer a clear and practical example, making the concept of DFT more accessible and enjoyable to grasp. Through this small exercise, we hope it will provide you with a solid foundation and enhance your understanding of DFT,encouraging you to explore its applications further. Happy learning!"

    "# 1. A Historical Perspective\n",
    "Before getting to DFT, Let's start from Fourier series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research of Fourier analysis start in 1748 with L. Euler, who examined the motion of a vibrating string (). What Euler noted was\n",
    "that the vibration consists of some basic components, the so-called \"normal mode\". And further, at certain point in time, the position of the vibrating string is a linear combination of these normal modes.\n",
    "<div align=center>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./resources/normal_modes.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "    <div>Figure 1. Normal modes of a vibrating string. Figure from Signals and Systems (2nd edition), Alan V. Oppenheim. </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "If you want to \n",
    "Not only for string vibration, there is a large class of interesting functions could be represented by linear combinations of a series of simple periodic signals (sinusoids originally, but now we use complex exponentials more, which is even simpler). In fact, breaking signals into simpler components do facilitate the analysis of, and computation with them. This is not only in sound study, but also motivated by research of heat propagation and diffusion in physics. Finally, after the hard work of Fourier, Dirichlet, and other predecessors, we now know that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Roughly, once you can [draw a **periodic signal** on a paper](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Dirichlet_conditions), you can decompose it into a combination of complex exponential signals ([Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series) representation). (Note: complex exponentials is not complicated though, it is just a \"coiled spring\" along the time axis.)\n",
    "- Such decomposition also works for **aperiodic** signals---just treat it as signals with infinite period ([Fourier transform, FT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, FT is widely used in audio analysis and processing. With its help, we can visualize frequency components of audio, and even manupulate them. Specifically, due to audio is stored with sample points in digital devices, FT can be achieved in the version for discrete signals--Discrete-Time FT (DTFT), which produces a continuous spectrogram. Further, its discrete version, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), produces a discrete spectrogram, and is easier to implement. When analyzing a short span of signals (it's aperiodic itself), DFT is the Fourier series coefficients of a counterpart periodic signal, which equals to the signal-to-be-analyzed in each period. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to have some further review of relevant concepts, you can have a quick scan of [Oppenheim's Signals and Systems](https://eee.guc.edu.eg/Courses/Communications/COMM401%20Signal%20&%20System%20Theory/Alan%20V.%20Oppenheim,%20Alan%20S.%20Willsky,%20with%20S.%20Hamid-Signals%20and%20Systems-Prentice%20Hall%20(1996).pdf), Chapters 2~4.\n",

    "Due to various reasons, violin sound in microphone tend to be quite different than its sound in live performance. In this recording, the sound has a bit \"dark\" timbre, making it not quite suitable for a contemporary music. To make the sound \"lighter\", having more \"presence\", we can use a tool called Equalizer (EQ) to tune its frequency component, specifically, make the components with higher frequency \"stronger\".\n",
